# Wordle Helper



Wordle Helper takes all valid 5-letter words and rule them out based on the constraints you've set. The input user experience is made to be similar to the actual game, invoking users' familiarity to minimize learning curve. Users declare the letter and positional constraints (e.g: no 'a', 'n', 'f' in word. 'g' must be the 5th letter) and a master word array is then filtered in multiple steps. A probability-based letter ranking for each letter-position is also provided.

A weekend project of mine.
